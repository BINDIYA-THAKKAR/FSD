#DOM (Document Object Model )
    Dom has predefined objects available in browser only . Within browser DOM takes up the responsibility to display in it to the user.
     >> Using Dom objects JS we can perform various operation like creating a new element , 
     >> changing the look and feel on some event , 
     >> Making an element visible/invisible
    Thats why DOM is very much used in Dynamic html

    iN dOM base object is Document. Using Document object we can select various element using predefined method like
    >> Find element by ID
    >> Find element by name et..

When we are using Document.getElementbyId returns one value and when we are using elementbyname reyurns multiple value means array

some funtions like doccument.GetElementByTagName() ,doccument.GetElementByclassName() returns HTML collections
To use HTML collections we have to first convert html collection to array by using Array.from method
Array.from(elements).forEach(element => {
                alert(element.innerText)
            });
